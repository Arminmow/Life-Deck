# üéÆ LifeDeck ‚Äì Like a Steam Library, but for Your Life

LifeDeck is a minimal productivity companion designed to help you track your sessions, reflect on your progress, and stay consistent with your goals.

It‚Äôs kinda like a Steam library ‚Äî but instead of games, you log real-life activities. You can:

- Track time spent on activities like coding, studying, workouts, etc.
- Write quick session reports to keep a personal log of what you actually did
- Add achievements to celebrate progress (just like Steam trophies)
- Stay motivated by seeing how consistent you've been over time

### It's not much but it include these:
- Real-time sync 
- Cloud persistence
- Redux state management
- Typed (Typescript) + Modular architecture
- Responsive UI
- Installable as a PWA & Offline support (in progress)
