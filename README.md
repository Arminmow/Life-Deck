# 🎮 LifeDeck – Like a Steam Library, but for Your Life

LifeDeck is a minimal productivity companion designed to help you track your sessions, reflect on your progress, and stay consistent with your goals.

It’s kinda like a Steam library — but instead of games, you log real-life activities. You can:

- Track time spent on activities like coding, studying, workouts, etc.
- Write quick session reports to keep a personal log of what you actually did
- Add achievements to celebrate progress (just like Steam trophies)
- Stay motivated by seeing how consistent you've been over time

## ⚙️ Built With
- Next.js + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
- Framer Motion for animations
- Firebase Firestore for real-time sync
